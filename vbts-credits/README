vbts-credits: Billing stuff for VBTS.

Requirements
============
You need to have a compatible dialplan that looks like this somewhere:

    <action application="set" data='service_type=outside_call'/>
    <action application="set" data='credits=${python(OpenBTS_DB SELECT secondsRemaining FROM sip_buddies WHERE name="${username}")}'/>
    <action application="set" data='call_tariff=${python(VBTS_DB_Get account_balance|name|${username})}'/>
    <action application="set" data='sec_avail=${expr( floor(${credits} / (${call_tariff} / 60)))}'/>
    <action application="set" data="execute_on_answer=sched_hangup +${sec_avail} alloted_timeout" />

We use the "secondsRemaining" field to denote the amount of local currency the
subscriber has in their account (that is, that field is in units of
dollars/rupiah/etc, not seconds!).

You need to have lighttpd and freeswitch installed as well. We assume the
lighttpd webroot is /var/www; change setup.py if it's not.

Freeswitch needs to have mod_xml_cdr set up to send CDR via HTTP POST to the
address of your lighttpd server.

Setting prices
==============
All the prices are set in the /etc/vbts_credits.conf file (it's just YAML). You
can add any line with an integer value and treat it as a service type. You can
adjust costs by changing this file; since vbts_credit does all the cost
computation, the changes take effect immediately.

Things this does
================
Assuming you have a compatible dialplan, this will handle charging people for
the usage. vbts_credits is the main module that controls access to the
subscriber registry.
