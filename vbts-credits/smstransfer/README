Basic UX:
- To transfer, user send NUMBER*AMOUNT to a short code.
- User gets a message back saying "To confirm transferring AMOUNT to NUMBER, reply to this message with the word "C<code>" in the next 30 minutes.
- Other user gets an SMS saying "You've gotten a transfer of AMOUNT from NUMBER. Your new balance is BALANCE."
